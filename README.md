This is a collection of resources for Mathematical Olympiads

# How to contribute
Just send a pull request. Please keep the following points in mind.
- Only include quality articles/resources. I would have loved to keep beginner level handouts
but then the collection wont look compact
- Do not include pirated content. (Especially not which are available on libgen (Hope you get the pun))
- If you get lot of articles on specific topic, plz include them in a subtopic which describes all of them well (for example , articles on **moving points** )
